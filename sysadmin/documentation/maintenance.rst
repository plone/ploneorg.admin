Maintenance
===========

Procedure
---------

Occasionally, things like software upgrades and hardware replacment must occur 
on plone.org. To facilitate this process, we generally try to schedule maintenance
windows at least one week in advance.

If you are a member of the admin's team, and you are considering an action that 
will require plone.org downtime (i.e. outage of any plone.org :doc:`service </services>`), please
create a news item on plone.org (e.g. http://plone.org/plone.org-upgrade-coming) 
and submit it for publication.

After submitting, please notify someone with publishing-ability in #plone and ask
them to review/publish it. E.g. limi, baekholt, jonstahl.
