Subversion Repository Management
================================

The Plone.org admins are responsible for the management of the following
repositories:

- https://svn.plone.org/svn/archetypes
- https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective
- https://svn.plone.org/svn/foundation
- https://svn.plone.org/svn/plone

Servers
-------

The primary server is OSU's deus.plone.org with a mirror to XS4ALL's 
antiloop.plone.org.

Users
-----

The repositories are owned by the ``www-data`` user.

Mirroring
---------

In /etc/cron.hourly on deus we have::

    #!/bin/sh

    LOCKFILE=/var/lock/cron.svn-mirror

    if [ -x /usr/bin/lockfile-create ] ; then
        lockfile-create $LOCKFILE
        if [ $? -ne 0 ] ; then
            cat <<EOF

    Unable to run /etc/cron.daily/svn-mirror because lockfile $LOCKFILE
    acquisition failed. This probably means that the previous day's
    instance is still running. Please check and correct if necessary.

    EOF
            exit 1
        fi

        # Keep lockfile fresh
        lockfile-touch $LOCKFILE &
        LOCKTOUCHPID="$!"
    fi

    for repo in archetypes plone collective ; do
            su www-data -c "svnsync sync https://svn-mirror.plone.org/svn/$repo --non-interactive" > /dev/null
    done

    if [ -x /usr/bin/lockfile-create ] ; then
        kill $LOCKTOUCHPID
        lockfile-remove $LOCKFILE
    fi

Occasionally when mirroring on ``deus`` you may get an error like this::

    Failed to get lock on destination repos…

At which point the following command should help::

    svn pdel --revprop -r 0 svn:sync-lock https://svn-mirror.plone.org/svn/<repo>
